# Ticket Price Comparison Website - CapstoneProject repository of CSCI 6806 capstone project

## Introduction

### Problem Statement

Purchasing movie tickets can be a cumbersome process, requiring users to search across multiple platforms for the best prices and nearest cinema locations. However, most of the websites/apps may only contain limited information about the movie. Recognizing the importance of streamlining this experience, our team is dedicated to creating a movie ticket price comparison and information website.

### Significance

The significance of our project extends beyond ticket price comparison and movie information. It encompasses a commitment to inclusivity, diversity, and accessibility. We also aim to address the unique needs of moviegoers interested in independent film genres, international films, and films with features such as described audio and multilingual subtitles. Our platform will be designed to cater to a broad audience, fostering an environment of inclusivity.

### Unique Features

In addition to ticket price comparison and comprehensive movie information, our project incorporates innovative features. We aspire to become a hub for users seeking diverse cinematic experiences. This includes features like accessible movie content (described audio and multilingual subtitles), and a focus on independent and international films. Furthermore, we aim to enhance user satisfaction by implementing a user-history based recommendation system that suggests content tailored to individual preferences.

### Main Objectives

Our primary objectives remain centered on user convenience and engagement. We intend to develop a user-friendly website for comparing movie ticket prices across a wide spectrum of theaters and websites. This website will also seamlessly integrate data from Rotten Tomatoes and IMDb. Beyond this, our commitment to diversity and accessibility underscores our dedication to creating an inclusive cinematic platform.

### Target Audience

Initially, our focus is on Canadian movie audiences, and this expansion caters to individuals seeking diverse cinematic experiences. This includes moviegoers interested in independent films, international cinema, and those requiring accessibility features such as described audio and multilingual subtitles.

### Distinguishing Features and Improvement

Our project innovates by not only simplifying ticket purchasing but also by enhancing the moviegoing experience for a broader audience. Additionally, our recommendation system, driven by user histories, fosters engagement and content discovery.

## Approach

We will solve the problem by developing a comprehensive movie information and ticket price comparison website that makes the process of buying cinema tickets easier for users. Our website will offer the following solutions:

### Price Comparison

Synchronize and integrate ticket prices across various theater chains, allowing users to compare prices from different sources in one place, by eliminating the need to log in to multiple websites.

### Movie Information

Integrate data from Rotten Tomatoes and IMDb to provide users with detailed information about movies, including ratings, reviews, and actors.

### User Convenience

Focus on user-friendly features and user reviews and ratings to aid easier decision-making.

### Future Expansion

Keep the option open for expanding our services to include orchestra, musicals, and other events in the future.

Our purpose is to create a user-friendly website for movie enthusiasts, offering comprehensive movie information and ticket price comparisons as our primary focus. The product will allow users to:

- Search for movies and theaters.
- Compare ticket prices across different theaters and websites
- Access comprehensive movie information from Rotten Tomatoes and IMDb
- Receive movie recommendations based on user preferences
- Read and contribute user reviews and ratings

By using the .NET Core framework for the website to synchronize and compare ticket prices, we are developing algorithms to fetch and analyze data from different sources. We are implementing the website using the .NET Core platform and a combination of programming languages and libraries suitable for web development. The choice of hardware will primarily depend on the hosting and infrastructure provider. Typically, cloud-based AWS solution is preferred for DB web applications due to its scalability, reliability, and ease of maintenance. DotNET Core is cross-platform, allowing deployment on various operating systems. The specific choice will be made based on compatibility and optimization for the selected hosting provider. We will use C# for the backend development because it is the primary language for .NET Core, offering strong support for web application development. The selection of libraries will depend on the specific requirements of the project, but common libraries and frameworks used in web development, such as Entity Framework for RDBMS database access and ASP.NET Core for web APIs.
